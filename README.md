# Theremin Glove
The Theremin Glove is a theremin inspired electronic instrument. Like the theremin, it is played with hand movements and gestures in the air. In electronics terms, it is a digitally controlled analog synthesizer and a wireless glove controller.
 
This project was started for the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering *Embedded Systems Lab* course in September 2019 and the working prototype should be demonstrated in December 2019. This course is an Electrical and Computer Engineerng graduate level capstone class that emulates the design process from requirement definitions to project demonstration.

I came up with the concept for this project as a way to combine areas of my engineering interests, which include:
* Analog circuit design
* Digital circuit design
* Firmware design (in this case, it's C programming for the ATMega328P)
* PCB design

## Features
* Pitch control - raising and lowering hand raises and lowers the frequency generated by the analog synthesizer
* Definable pitch range - the pitch range is set by first defining where the lowest note exists (i.e. place hand at the bottom of range) and press a button to start range recording. Then raise hand to where the highest note is and press a button to save. This is required because hand placement will be detected by an accelerometer which doesn't measure absolute height.
* Tone control - tilting hand in and out sweeps the resonant frequencies of the analog filters in the synthesizer
* Volume control - opening and closing hand raises and lowers the volume

## System
### Glove
* XBee3 wireless RF transceiver - transmits sensor data to digital analog synthesizer controller
* ATMega328P microcontroller - reads the sensor data and pushes to the XBee3 over SPI
* I2C interface to 6DoF sensor
* ADC interface to bend sensor
* USB-UART interface to ATMega328P and XBee3 for debug
* AVR SPI ISP header for ATMega328P programming
* Battery powered
* USB re-chargeable

### Digital Analog Synthesizer Controller
* XBee3 wireless RF transceiver - receives sensor data from glove
* ATMega328P microcontroller - interprets sensor data and calculates controls to analog synthesizer
* I2C interface to 4-channel DAC and IO expander
* USB-UART interface to ATMega328P and XBee3 for debug
* AVR SPI ISP header for ATMega328P programming

### Analog Synthesizer
* 4-channel DAC - provides control voltages to analog circuis
* I2C IO expander - provides a greater number of control signals
* VCO - generates square, triangle, and sine waveforms
* VCF - variable low pass, band pass, and high pass filters
* VCA - variable volume amplifier
* Analog muxes to select waveforms and filtering
* Audio output

### Power Board
* Input 12VAC (2A max)
* Ouput :
 * +3.3V DC (1.5A max) for digital circuits
 * +/-12V DC (1.5A max each) for analog circuits
